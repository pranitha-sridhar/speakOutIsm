# Data Security:

1)Data theft can happen due to database having public rules. So, we changed the rules of the sensitive data, such that only an authorised person will be able to access them.

2)We have made our own server in MongoDB and API call is done through that to protect the secret key from being exposed of FCM. So this will go and get the credentials     and will call the FCM to send notifications.

3)There may be many fraudulent activities that may happen, when users are allowed to log-in from multiple devices. So it will be better to restrict to just one device.      Added auto sign out feature using FCM Data message, which runs in background services.
